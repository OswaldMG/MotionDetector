# MoveDetector
## [Introduction]
This project was carried out with the purpose of testing the functionalities of the OpenCV library in c/c++. This so that we could use a computer webcam as a motion sensor, to make the project more interesting the team decided to add a video game in which this motion detector functionality would be implemented, and what a more ideal game would be than "Just-Dance", one where to play you must move so that the device captures your movements. This would be our goal, to emulate "Just-Dance" to make it work without the need of a game console itself.
## [How to use it]
1. First, you have to had been downloaded Visual Studio and OpenCV
   1.1 Visual Studio needs to have the c++ language installed
   1.2 OpenCV needs to be configured in c++, you can use the next tutorial (https://gist.github.com/demid5111/6faa590e4fc5813550dd95cc1c538893)
3. When you have installed them, download the zip archive of this repository
